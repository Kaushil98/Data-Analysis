AtliQ Grands is a chain of five-star hotels in India that has been facing a decline in revenue due to market competition and ineffective decision-making. As a strategic move, the company has decided to incorporate business and data intelligence to regain their market share and revenue. As a data analyst, I have been tasked with creating a dashboard that provides insights from historical data to the revenue management team.


# Objective/Task

As a data analyst for AtliQ Grands, I was tasked with the following:

- Create the metrics according to the metric list provided by stakeholders.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

To accomplish these tasks, I analyzed the provided sample data and created the necessary metrics and dashboard to help the revenue management team make informed decisions to increase occupancy rates, ADR, and RevPAR, and capture more market share. I also provided additional insights based on my analysis to help identify opportunities to improve guest satisfaction and optimize pricing and promotions.

# Metric List
The following metrics have been provided by stakeholders:

1) Occupancy Rate: percentage of occupied rooms during a specific period.
2) Average Daily Rate (ADR): average price paid for each room sold during a specific period.
3) Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR): total revenue generated per available room during a specific period.
