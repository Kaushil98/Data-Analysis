AtliQ Grands is a chain of five-star hotels in India that has been facing a decline in revenue due to market competition and ineffective decision-making. As a strategic move, the company has decided to incorporate business and data intelligence to regain their market share and revenue. As a data analyst, I have been tasked with creating a dashboard that provides insights from historical data to the revenue management team.


# Objective/Task

As a data analyst for AtliQ Grands, I was tasked with the following:

- Create the metrics according to the metric list provided by stakeholders.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

To accomplish these tasks, I analyzed the provided sample data and created the necessary metrics and dashboard to help the revenue management team make informed decisions to increase occupancy rates, ADR, and RevPAR, and capture more market share. I also provided additional insights based on my analysis to help identify opportunities to improve guest satisfaction and optimize pricing and promotions.

# Metric List
The following metrics have been provided by stakeholders:

1) Occupancy Rate: percentage of occupied rooms during a specific period.
2) Average Daily Rate (ADR): average price paid for each room sold during a specific period.
3) Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR): total revenue generated per available room during a specific period.


# Conclusion with Insights Gained

Based on the metrics provided, the revenue management team at AtliQ Grands can make informed decisions to increase occupancy rates, ADR, and RevPAR, and capture more market share. Some of the business tasks that can be accomplished with the insights gained from these metrics include:

- Identifying periods of low occupancy and adjusting pricing and promotions to increase bookings.
- Analyzing ADR trends to ensure that the hotel is pricing competitively compared to similar hotels in the area.
- Focusing on increasing RevPAR through upselling and cross-selling amenities and services.
- Comparing MPI with competitors to identify areas where the hotel can capture more market share.
- Analyzing ALOS trends to identify opportunities to increase guest satisfaction and repeat bookings.

By incorporating data analytics and business intelligence, AtliQ Grands can regain their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. They can make data-driven decisions to optimize pricing and promotions, improve guest satisfaction, and stay competitive in the market


# Key Learnings

Throughout the AtliQ Grands project, I gained experience in the following areas:

- Understanding the importance of data-driven decision making in the hospitality industry to optimize revenue and gain a competitive edge.
- Developing a comprehensive revenue management plan and utilizing data analytics to identify potential areas of revenue leakage and missed opportunities.
- Creating relevant and meaningful metrics to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Occupancy Rate, and Market Penetration Index (MPI).
- Using data visualization techniques to create an interactive dashboard that provides a real-time snapshot of revenue and occupancy metrics to help management make informed decisions.
- Identifying trends and patterns in historical data to gain insights into consumer behavior and preferences, and using those insights to drive revenue and improve customer experience.
- Utilizing statistical analysis and predictive modeling to forecast future demand and revenue, and develop pricing strategies that maximize revenue.
Communicating complex data analysis findings and insights to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, and using their feedback to refine the analysis and drive better results.

These key learnings have provided me with a solid foundation in revenue management and data analytics in the hospitality industry, and have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle similar challenges in the future

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the AtliQ Grands project provided an excellent opportunity to apply various data analytics and visualization techniques to gain insights into business revenue. By analyzing the data and creating an interactive dashboard, we were able to identify key areas of improvement and recommend strategies to help AtliQ Grands regain its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
