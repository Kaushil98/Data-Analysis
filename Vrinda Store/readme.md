# Project Overview
The project involves analyzing sales data for Vrinda Store for the year 2022 and creating a comprehensive annual sales report.
The report includes:

- A summary of total sales for the year, broken down by month, product category, and geographic region
* An analysis of customer demographics, including age, gender, and location
- An analysis of customer behavior, including purchase frequency and purchase history
- Recommendations for improving sales in 2023 based on the data analysis

# Methodology
To create the annual sales report, I used a combination of data analysis tools, including Microsoft Excel and PowerBI. The process involved:

- Collecting and organizing sales data for the year 2022
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis
- Using data visualization tools to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns
- Creating charts and graphs to visualize the data and make it easier to understand
- Generating insights and recommendations based on the data analysis

# Data
The data for this project includes information about sales and orders from a business. It contains details such as order date, order status, customer information, product information, and sales information. The data is available in a CSV file.

# Tasks
The following tasks were performed as part of this project:

- Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.
- Determine which month had the highest sales and orders.
- Analyze whether men or women purchased more in 2022.
- Identify the different order statuses in 2022.
- List the top 10 states contributing to sales.
- Analyze the relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders.
- Determine which channel contributed to the maximum sales.
- Identify the highest selling category.

# Conclusion & Insights
The analysis of this data can help the business in making informed decisions related to sales and marketing strategies. The results of this project can be further used for forecasting and predicting future trends.Based on the insights gathered from the analysis of sales and orders data, the following suggestions can be made to improve Vrinda store sales:

1) Target women customers: Women are more likely to buy compared to men, therefore, the business can focus on targeting women customers by providing offers and discounts that are specific to their interests.

2) Focus on specific age group: Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is contributing the most to the sales, so the business can focus on providing products and services that cater to this age group's interests and preferences.

3) Target specific states: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states contributing to the sales, so the business can focus on targeting these states by providing location-based offers and discounts.

4) Use specific channels: Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are contributing the most to the sales, so the business can focus on these channels by providing offers and discounts available on these platforms.

5) By targeting women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in specific states and by focusing on specific sales channels, the business can increase its sales and improve its profitability.
