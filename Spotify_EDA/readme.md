This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Spotify Songs dataset. The dataset contains information about various songs on the Spotify platform, including attributes such as song title, artist, duration, popularity, and audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo.

The project has been implemented using Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

# Business Tasks
Through this project, we can answer the following business tasks:

- What is the distribution of popular songs on Spotify?
- Which genres are most popular on Spotify?
- What is the relationship between song attributes such as danceability, energy,loudness and more?
- Can we predict the popularity of a song based on its audio features?

 # Running the project
 To use this project, you can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal. Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the project and extract it to your desired location.

After installing the prerequisites and downloading the dataset, you can open the Jupyter Notebook file spotify_songs_eda.ipynb in your IDE and run the cells.

The notebook contains detailed explanations of the code and the data analysis process. The analysis includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis of various features such as popularity, duration, and audio features
- Data visualization using various charts and plots

# Key Learnings
Through this project, I learn the following skills:

1) Loading and preprocessing data using pandas
2) Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset
3) Visualizing data using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
4) Analyzing the characteristics of various songs on the Spotify platform
5) Gaining insights into the popularity and trends of songs on Spotify

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides insights into the Spotify Songs dataset through data analysis and visualization. The results of the analysis can be used to gain insights into the popularity and characteristics of various songs on the Spotify platform. The key learnings from this project can be applied to any other dataset and help in gaining insights and making data-driven decisions
