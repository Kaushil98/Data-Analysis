# Objective
The objective of this project was to create an interactive dashboard for Madhav Store to track and analyze their online sales data. The dashboard needed to provide insights into sales performance by product, region, and time period, and enable users to identify trends and patterns in the data.

# Project Overview
To achieve the objective, I designed an online sales dashboard that consists of multiple worksheets and visualizations, including:

- A summary dashboard that provides an overview of online sales data by product, region, and time period
- Detailed worksheets that allow users to drill down into specific products or regions and analyze sales data in more detail
- Customized visualizations, such as clustered bar charts and scatter charts, that enable users to identify trends and patterns in the data

The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and slice the data to customize their view of the data. Users can filter the data by date range, product category, or geographic region. The dashboard also includes user-driven parameters that allow users to customize the visualizations based on their specific needs.

# Key Learnings
Throughout the project, I gained experience in the following areas:

- Creating an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data
- Using complex parameters to drill down into worksheets and customizing filters and slicers
- Creating connections, joining new tables, and using calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations
- Using different types of customized visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers

# Installation and Usage
To use the Madhav Store online sales dashboard, you will need to have Microsoft Excel and PowerBI installed on your computer. Once you have installed these programs, you can download the project files from this repository.

To open the online sales dashboard, simply open the Excel file and navigate to the "Dashboard" worksheet. From there, you can interact with the various visualizations and use the filters and slicers to customize your view of the data.

# Conclusion

I believe that this project showcases my skills in data visualization and manipulation, as well as my ability to create interactive and user-friendly reports. I am confident that this project will be of value to Madhav Store and other businesses that are looking to track and analyze their online sales data.
